<p>Erra P. is a music duo based in Ireland and Amsterdam, with a focus on Techno, Tech-House, House music; with occasional journeys into Deep House, Raw and Dub genres.

Formed in 2016, Erra P. embodies the collective musical experiences of Steffen Coonan AKA AISENMA Beatz, a long time DJ and Producer, with a keen ear for all genres of House and Techno, and Ciaran Oâ€™Brien, a classically trained musician with a deep understanding of musical composition, engineering and mastering. This fusion of backgrounds and skills has enabled them to craft a sound that stands out in the saturated landscape of electronic music.</p>
